{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 0  
>
> Blink built-in LED in TinkerCAD

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 1  
>
> In TinkerCAD, program default moves for a servo (0º, 90º, 180º, 0º, …)

{: .challenge-title}
> 💪 Challenge 0
>
> Build this simple circuit and program the Arduino with the code from [Task 1](Task1)

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 2
>
> In TinkerCAD, use functions to make programming the servos easier.

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 3
>
> In TinkerCAD, use Serial Monitor to add debug statements when the servo receives an angle.

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 4
>
> In TinkerCAD, program the servo to read a potentiometer and set angle accordingly

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 1  
>
> Build the circuit in [Task 4](Task4) on the breadboard (don't be put off if it doesn't work immediately!)

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 5
>
> Add a switch (either TinkerCAD/breadboard/both) to enable/disable the servo (you cannot turn off the servos power)

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 2  
>
> Swap the servo for an LED + resistor in series. What happens? What happens when you flip the switch? (this depends how you completed [Task 5](Task5))


{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 3  
>
> Write a program that when you flip a switch, you can switch between course and fine movement on servo

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 4  
>
> Write a program that controls two servos with one potentiometer, using one switch to change which one is being controlled

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 5
>
> Write a program that controls the servo angle by entering in a value into the Serial Monitor *(hint: Use `Serial.parseInt()`)*.
