> 📝 Task 0  
>
> Blink built-in LED in TinkerCAD

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 1  
>
> In TinkerCAD, program default moves for a servo (0d, 90d, 180d, 0d, …)

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 2  
>
> In TinkerCAD, program the servo to accept input from the user via serial monitor

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 3  
>
> In TinkerCAD, program the servo to read a potentiometer and set angle accordingly

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 1  
>
> Build the circuit in Task 3 on the breadboard (don't be put off if it doesn't work immediately!)

{: .tip-title }
> 📝 Task 4  
>
> Add a switch (either TinkerCAD/breadboard/both) to enable/disable the servo (you cannot turn off the servos power)

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 2  
>
> Swap the servo for an LED + resistor in series. What happens? (Depending on your implementation, what happens when you flip the switch?)

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 3  
>
> Write a program that when you flip a switch, you can switch between course and fine movement on servo

{: .challenge-title }
> 💪 Challenge 4  
>
> Write a program that controls two servos with one potentiometer, using one switch to change which one is being controlled
