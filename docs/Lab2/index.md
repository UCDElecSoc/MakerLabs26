# MakerLab2 - Signals to Speed (ft. UCDFS)
Join [*Joe Biju*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebiju456/) for our second MakerLab - this time diving into the world of motor controllers and electromechanical motion. Whether you're curious about how robots move, how PWM controls speed, or what makes a servo tick, this hands-on session is for you!

We also have a guest speaker from UCD Formula Student: [*Kieran McIlreavy*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieranmcilreavy/) (Vice-Powertrain Captain last year). He will be sharing with us the behind-the-scenes details of building an EV car, including the kind of technology used, such as regenerative braking, Field-Oriented Control, and more! 

This lab will explore:
- How microcontrollers can **control DC motors, servos, and more**
- Using **PWM** to vary speed and direction
- Concepts like **torque, back-EMF, and H-bridges**
- How to **wire and safely power** your circuit, as well as **program** simple movements.

This session builds on the basics - but beginners are still absolutely welcome. By the end, you'll have built your own working motor driver circuit and earned a free certificate for your CV!

And of course... thereâ€™s a secret prize for the top performer ðŸ‘€

Come along for some fun, practical learning - no prior experience needed!
