Join Joe Biju for our second MakerLab - this time diving into the world of motor controllers and electromechanical motion. Whether you're curious about how robots move, how PWM controls speed, or what makes a servo tick, this hands-on session is for you!

Weâ€™ll explore:
- How microcontrollers can control DC motors, servos, and more
- Using PWM to vary speed and direction
- Concepts like torque, back-EMF, and H-bridges
- How to wire and safely power your circuit, as well as program simple movements.

This session builds on the basics - but beginners are still absolutely welcome. By the end, you'll have built your own working motor driver circuit and earned a free certificate for your CV!

And of course... thereâ€™s a secret prize for the top performer ðŸ‘€

Come along for some fun, practical learning - no prior experience needed!
