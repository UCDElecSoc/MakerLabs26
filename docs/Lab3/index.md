# MakerLab3 - Serovs & Linkages
Join [*Liam O'Sullivan*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-osullivan-/) and [*Joe Biju*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joebiju456/) for our third MakerLab - tthis time we’re bringing together the RGB LEDs from Lab 1 and the servos from Lab 2. Whether you missed an earlier session and want to catch up, or you’ve already been to the first two labs and crave a tougher challenge, this hands-on workshop has something for everyone!

This lab will explore:
- **Driving RGB LEDs** with microcontrollers: PWM for smooth colour mixing and timed light effects
- More **advanced Servo mechanisms**: angle mapping, speed control, and chaining multiple servos
- **Mechanical linkages and robotic arms**: simple linkages, mounting servos, and basic kinematics
- **Interfacing an LCD screen** to show simple menus

This session builds on the basics - but beginners are absolutely welcome. If you’re catching up, there will be guided stations covering RGB wiring and single-servo control. For confident builders, we’ve prepared multiple challenges, including assembling a 2 degrees of freedom robotic arm. By the end, you’ll have a working prototype and earn a MakerLab certificate for your CV!

And as always, there’s a secret prize for the top performer 👀

Come tinker, learn, and link things together - no prior experience required!
