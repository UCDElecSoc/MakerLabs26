# Blog Post
Our first session, "RGB Controllers", was a huge hit. We had a strong attendance and everyone had fun trying and building their own RGB light strips ðŸš¥

In fact, 6 people especially stood out for exceptional effort, which we'd like to highlight!
- [Saoirse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saoirse-o-neill-654774370) & Mia
- [Frudi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fuk-chi-frudi-chan-521183253) & Nide
- [Abdus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdus-samad-bhadmus-64029b243) & Colm

All of them will receive their own RGB strip as a prize for their impressive performances ðŸ”¥

If you missed out, don't worry! Our next one will be announced shortly (it may involve fast spinning things ðŸ‘€). Make sure to follow us on Insta & join our WhatsApp community to get the latest ðŸ“£

See you there!
