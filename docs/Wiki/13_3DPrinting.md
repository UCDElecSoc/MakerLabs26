# 3D Printing
An additive manufacturing process that creates physical objects layer by layer from a digital design. It is particularly useful for rapid prototyping.
## FDM 3D Printing
(Fused Deposition Modelling)

FDM printing works by melting plastic filament (such as PLA or ABS) and extruding it layer by layer through a nozzle.

## Resin 3D Printing
Resin 3D printing uses liquid photopolymer resin that hardens when exposed to UV light.
The printer builds objects layer by layer using a light source.
