# Variables

Named storage locations that hold data values.

**float**

Stores decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14).
Example code:
```cpp
float pi = 3.14;
```
**boolean**
Stores true or false values.
Example code:
```cpp
bool isValid = true;
```
**int**

Stores whole numbers.
Example code:
```cpp
int age = 21;
```

**double**

Stores decimal numbers with higher precision (on many Arduinos, same as float).
Example code:
```cpp
double distance = 12.345;
```
**Character**

Stores a single character.
Example code:
```cpp
char grade = 'A';
```
**String**
Stores text (characters and words).
Example code:
```cpp
string location = "Moon";
```
