# Arduino IDE
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is widely used for learning, prototyping, and building electronic projects.

Arduino IDE is the software used to write, compile, and upload code (called sketches) to Arduino boards. It uses a simplified version of C/C++.
